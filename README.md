## Introduction

This study aims to predict the Earned Run Average (ERA) of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers using deep learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and various performance metrics, we strive to create a model that can provide accurate ERA predictions, helping teams make informed decisions.

## Dataset

In this study, we used data from 2015-2023 of mlb pitchers. We divided the criteria into Basic and Statcast to distinguish basic baseball statistical data and data collected with the latest technology. After that, it was used for training the proposed model, and the results were compared with existing projection systems. More information is available in the data folder.
